# Our Game is a MegaMan-like side scrolling game, where the player character is a Dragon breathing warrior on a mission to collect Gemstones to restore his villages honor. As the protagonist, the player will run, jump, shoot enemies, and avoid obstacles while retrieving the sacred kiwi gems. 
# We used many free assets as well as a Minecraft background audio for our showcase of the game, with the goal of hopefully adding original music in the future 
# Omar worked on Level design and movement.
# Marcos worked on main menu, gem collection/ inventory 
# Diego worked on the obstacles and enemies
# Darren worked on the win condition and checkpoint
# Charles worked on the timer and pause menu
